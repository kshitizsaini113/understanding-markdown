# Blockquotes using MD
```
Blockquoting a paragraph requires adding '>' symbol before a paragraph

Example: 
> This is a BlockQuote
```
> MThis is a BlockQuote

## Blockquoting multiple paragraphs together.
```
Leave a blank line with > only to connect blockquoted paragraphs.

> ...P1...
>
> ...P2...
```
> My name is Kshitiz Saini.
>
> This is for learning MarkDown.

# Nested Blockquoting
```
Use >> instead of > for nested blockquote.
```
> My name is Kshitiz Saini.
>
>> This is for learning MarkDown.
